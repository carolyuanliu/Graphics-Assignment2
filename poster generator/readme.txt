The poster expresses the scene that doctors all over the world are armed up and fighting with covid-19 virus. The reason why I choose this topic is that, I had worked in the front line for one month to help community to control the epidemic in China, I saw too many doctors and nurses going to the front line without thinking, for the safety of their families, they cannot go home for a very long time, but they still move forward. I know doctors in other countries are doing the same thing, they go to the opposite side and face the virus directly for such a long time, it is tough, but they are still fighting for us. It's very respective. 

This composition made up of seven layers, one layer of background image, three layers of foreground image, and three layers of text. All images are from the internet, and I edit them by photoshop. After that, I design a draft in photoshop and then write the script in python. 



Principles of design:
1.Symmetrical balance 
This poster is composed of two parts, the top part expresses the view of doctors' back and going to the front line, the bottom part expresses they are armed up and preparing for the fighting.

2.Proximity and Alignment
The composition is grouped by background image. The top part's background is a image of covid virus, the bottom part's background is a pure color. The lining up images in the bottom part and text in the middle emphasize the alignment.

3.Unity
All of images are in the unified tone. The text in same font conects the two parts to an uniform.

4.Emphasis
The similar people and similar actions emphasises the scene of front line. The yellow text emphasises the theme of the poster.

5.Rhythm
The similar people and similar actions also make up the rhythm.
